<p> <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    npm install -g karma-cli
 </pre>
<p>Now to run the coverage test, type:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">grunt karma:unitCoverage</pre>
<h3 id="coverage-tests-for-the-front-end_html-report">HTML Report</h3>
<p>The tests are part of documentation, as so when the docs are generated, the coverage report is created in HTML format.
